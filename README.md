# Marvin-Chess-AI-
Making a chess AI with a depth of one

This project is a going to be a chess AI with a depth of one.
This project isn't exactly intended to be good or useful, but I intend to expand on this later to make an actually helpful chess AI. As of writting this, however, it is nearly a complete chess engine, whihc might be helpful for making a 
simular project of your own.
The code is commented throughout, which should give a good understanding of how the code works. The main method is the Game.py file, you can run it to get the engine up and running.
If you have suggestions, feel free to leave them in the discusions tab so we can consider them.

A more complete README file will be finished when the project is finished, but I figure that while this project is unfinished there isn't much of a point to it now.
